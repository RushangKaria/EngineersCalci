This program checks whether a point lies on/inside/outside a circle.


PROGRAM: To check if a point lies on/inside/outside a circle

INPUT: The user provides the center-point form of the circle (center and radius) and the point to be checked 

OUTPUT: Whether the point lies on/inside/outside the circle 

CONSTRAINTS: The only input available is the center-point form, parametric etc. equations are not supported

ABSTRACT:
The equation of a circle is given as 
x2+y2+2gx+2fy+c=0
where
(-g,-f)=center
g2+f2-c=radius^2

f(x,y)=x2+y2+2gx+2fy+c

f(a,b)=a2+b2+2ga+2fb+c

f(a,b) 	  result
------------------
   0	| on
  -ve	| inside
  +ve	| outside


========================================== VARIABLE NOMENCLATURE ============================================

InputStreamReader |	user input streams
BufferedReader    |     

x --> the x co-ordinate of the center
y --> the y co-ordinate of the center
radius --> the radius of the circle

x1 --> the x co-ordinate of the point under consideration
y1 --> the y co-ordinate of the point under consideration
result --> the result String is stored in this variable {ON,INSIDE,OUTSIDE}

start() --> the driver module

take_input() --> used to take the center and radius from the user

formEquation() --> used to form the equation of the circle

class CircleVariable --> used to hold the equation of the circle...a critical component

check_where_point_lies() --> used to compute where the point lies

displayEquation() --> used to display the equation of the circle

printResult() --> used to print the result
